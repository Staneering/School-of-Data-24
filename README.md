# School-of-Data-24
2 months program in Data Science,Analysis and Engineering 



This program will cover data science, data analysis, and data engineering in two months. It aims to prepare students for entry-level roles in the field. The curriculum will include foundational topics like Python programming, data manipulation, and visualization, as well as advanced concepts such as machine learning and data engineering. Students will also have the opportunity to apply their skills through practical projects.
